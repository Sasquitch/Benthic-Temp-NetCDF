abstract = 'Given the increased glacier retreat,summer melts, sea level rise and ozone losses the intertidal zone is likely to be one of the most rapidly altering of environments but also one of the least investigated in polar waters. This study aims to quantify summer temperature variability in some habitats of the intertidal zone at King George Island. /nThree transects were selected across tidal flat. Four temperature loggers were deployed at each of them from extreme low water spring tide level to extreme high water spring tide level between 07.12.2010 and 18.03.2011. All the loggers were deployed at the rocky substratum. /nIn all the three transects average temperature increased with tidal height. Much higher temperature variability was recorded at higher than at lower tide locations. Differences in temperature between the three study transects existed. /nResults obtained from the studied tidal flat show that several factors combined altogether, including: water movement by tidal forces, wave action, air temperature, sun light intensity, shore lithology and the presence of ice and snow in the area, seem to influence its temperature.'
